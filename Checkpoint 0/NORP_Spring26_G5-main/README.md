# SoQL Query Generation with RAG
## Overview
* This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate SoQL queries based on natural language questions. 
* It leverages a dataset of Chicago crime data as retrieval context and uses a language model via the Openrouter API to formulate accurate queries which are the parameters for querying the Chicago Crimes API.
* The parameters that are in JSON format are extracted and used to query the API to fetch relevant data.
* **Group 5 Extension:** This repository also includes a systematic longitudinal analysis of violent crime across Chicago police districts (2015–2024), investigating whether the relationship between district-level socioeconomic factors and violent crime rates changed before and after 2020.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/KhalidBargoti/NORP.git
cd NORP
```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Environment Variables
Edit the `.env` file in the project root directory with the following contents:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
SOCRATA_APP_TOKEN=your_socrata_app_token
```

## LLM API
* This project utilizes the [Openrouter API](https://openrouter.ai/) for making queries to LLMs.
* You can make an account on the website to obtain an **API KEY** to store in your .env file and utilize several free models.
* The default model used is "mistralai/devstral-2512:free", but feel free to change it in the `main.py` file.

## Chicago Crimes API
* The project accesses the [Chicago Crimes Dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/about_data) via the [Socrata API](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofchicago.org/ijzp-q8t2) (v2.0)
* To get started, first make an account on the [City of Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) website.
* Once you make a profile, head to [developer settings](https://data.cityofchicago.org/profile/edit/developer_settings) and create a new **APP TOKEN** and store it in your .env file. Note that you need the APP TOKEN not the SECRET TOKEN

## Dataset
The file `data/combined_dataset.csv` is used only as retrieval context.
Each row typically contains:
- A natural language query
- Corresponding SoQL parameters
- Schema information
- Optional IUCR context - Codes for Chicago crime types

## Running the Project
From the project root directory:
```
python main.py
```
You will be prompted to enter a natural language question.
The program will:
* Retrieve relevant context rows
* Print the retrieved examples
* Generate SoQL parameters using the language model
* Execute the query and display results

## Generating the Crime Data and Plots (Group 5 Analysis)

### Step 1 — Extract violent crime data by district and year
```
python cp2_extraction.py
```
This script queries the Chicago Crimes API for each year from 2015 to 2024, filtering for five violent crime types (HOMICIDE, ROBBERY, CRIMINAL SEXUAL ASSAULT, AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, AGGRAVATED BATTERY) and groups results by police district.

**Output:** `data/cp2_violent_crimes_by_district_year.csv`
- 220 rows — 22 districts x 10 years
- Columns: `year`, `district`, `violent_crime_count`

### Step 2 — Run exploratory data analysis
```
python cp2_eda.py
```
This script reads the CSV produced in Step 1 and generates the following outputs.

**Plots** saved to `plots/`:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cp2_citywide_trend.png` | Citywide violent crime totals per year (2015-2024) |
| `cp2_district_heatmap.png` | District x year heatmap of crime counts |
| `cp2_pre_post_2020.png` | Average annual crimes per district, pre vs post 2020 |
| `cp2_pct_change.png` | % change in average crime by district, pre to post 2020 |

**Summary table** saved to `data/cp2_eda_summary.csv`:
- Per-district averages for pre-2020 and post-2020 periods
- Total crime count across the full study period
- Peak year and % change per district

> **Note:** Run `cp2_extraction.py` before `cp2_eda.py`. Both scripts read your `SOCRATA_APP_TOKEN` from the `.env` file automatically.

### Step 3 — Build the socioeconomic dataset
```
python cp3_socioeco.py
```
This script loads the Chicago Hardship Index (2008-2012 ACS, 77 community areas) and derives a community-area-to-police-district crosswalk directly from the Chicago Crimes API.

**Outputs:**
- `data/cp3_community_socioeco.csv` — per capita income, poverty rate, unemployment, education, and hardship index for each community area
- `data/cp3_community_to_district.csv` — community area to police district mapping
- `data/cp3_district_socioeco.csv` — socioeconomic indicators aggregated to district level

### Step 4 — Merge into panel dataset
```
python cp3_merge.py
```
Merges the CP2 crime data with the district-level socioeconomic indicators to produce a district x year panel dataset.

**Output:** `data/cp3_panel.csv`
- 140 rows — 14 matched districts x 10 years
- Columns: `year`, `district`, `violent_crime_count`, `per_capita_income`, `pct_poverty`, `pct_unemployed`, `pct_no_hs`, `hardship_index`, `post2020`

> **Note:** Run `cp2_extraction.py` first, then `cp3_socioeco.py`, then `cp3_merge.py`.

### Step 5 — Run statistical analysis
```
python cp3_analysis.py
```
Runs correlation analysis (split by pre/post-2020) and three OLS regression models including a structural break interaction test.

**Plots** saved to `plots/`:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cp3_correlation_matrix.png` | Correlation matrix across all socioeconomic variables and crime |
| `cp3_income_vs_crime.png` | Per capita income vs violent crime, pre vs post 2020 |
| `cp3_poverty_vs_crime.png` | Poverty rate vs violent crime, pre vs post 2020 |
| `cp3_hardship_vs_crime.png` | Hardship index vs violent crime, pre vs post 2020 |

**Data outputs:**
- `data/cp3_correlation_table.csv` — pre/post correlations and delta for each variable
- `data/cp3_regression_results.txt` — OLS model coefficients and R-squared values

**Key finding:** The relationship between socioeconomic conditions and violent crime weakened substantially after 2020. The hardship index correlation with crime dropped from +0.349 (pre-2020) to +0.072 (post-2020). Per capita income reversed sign from -0.241 to +0.120, suggesting the expected pattern of wealthier districts having less crime broke down post-2020.

### Step 6 — Advanced Analysis & Robustness Checks
```
python cp3_analysis.py
```
This step extends CP3 by validating whether results hold under alternative specifications.
**What this script does:**
- Normalizes crime counts to control for district-level scale differences
- Recomputes correlations (pre vs post 2020)
- Re-runs OLS regression models for direct comparison with CP3
- Evaluates robustness of coefficients and model fit
- Identifies influential districts (e.g., District 12)
- Generates structured outputs for reporting

**Data outputs:**
- data/cp4_panel_normalized.csv — normalized panel dataset
- data/cp4_correlation_table.csv — updated correlations
- data/cp4_regression_detailed.csv — full regression outputs
- data/cp4_robustness_summary.csv — model comparison summary
- data/cp4_analysis_notes.txt — key interpretations

**Plots** saved to `plots/`:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cp4_coef_plot_counts.png` | Coefficient comparison across models |
| `cp4_time_trend_counts.png` | Time trends in violent crime |
| `cp4_hardship_vs_crime_ci.png` | Hardship vs crime (with CI) |
| `cp4_income_vs_crime_ci.png` | Income vs crime (with CI) |
| `cp4_pre_post_hardship.png` | Pre/post hardship comparison |
| `cp4_pre_post_income.png` | Pre/post income comparison |

**Key finding:**
- Socioeconomic variables explain a substantial share of crime variation (R^2 \approx 0.42)
- Relationships between socioeconomic factors and violent crime weaken or shift after 2020
- Hardship index correlation drops significantly (+0.349 → +0.072)
- Income relationship reverses direction (−0.241 → +0.120)
- Structural break is confirmed via interaction models
- Normalization does not eliminate these effects, confirming they are not driven by scale differences
- District-level heterogeneity persists (notably District 12)

## Assignment Deliverables
Submit a short report describing your interaction with the system and the observations you made while using it.

### 1. Project Overview
